# Homework-3
Name: Allie Schoen

What I tell people about my field of study at a party: College level math has turned into an English class where we spend more time proving formulas rather than using them. Despite that, math is a very interesting subject which has a lot of applications in other majors and careers.

Three Main Activities: Working at the Ames Fitness Center, watching Below Deck while attempting my complex variables homework, and reading lots of papers for my humanities courses.

How I Organize Work:
1) I color code everything, including colored pens for note taking
2) I use the tasks for Canvas extension to track assignment due each week
3) I plan out my weekly schedule on my computer calendar
